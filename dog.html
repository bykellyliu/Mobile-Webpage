	<h3>Personalities</h3>
	<p>
			They are loyal and honest, amiable and kind, cautious and prudent. 
		<br />	
			Due to bearing a strong sense of loyalty and sincerity, they will do everything for the person who they think is most important. 
			
			As they are a little stupid and lack of communication skills, it is difficult for them to convey their minds to others. 
		<br />	
			Thus they easily leave others the impression of a stubborn person.
		
			Born with a good nature, dogs do not tend to be criminals and seek for dishonest gain. 
		<br />
			They just need a quiet life and a good family, and thus forget the ugliness and evil on earth. 
			
			They are ready to help others and do not care about their own interests, but if they find themselves betrayed by cunning people, they will feel shocked and hurt.
		<br />
			With doubt in mind, dogs think the world is evil and complicated. 
			
			They have sharp criticism when giving comments on something. 
		<br />	
			They incline to infer things in their point of view.
