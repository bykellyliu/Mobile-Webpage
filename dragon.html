	<h3>Personalities</h3>
	<p>
			The dragon is the most vital and powerful of any in the Chinese zodiac, although with an infamous reputation for being a hothead and possessing a sharp tongue. 
		<br />
			In ancient times, people thought that dragons could control everything in the world, for they symbolized the character traits of dominance and ambition.
		
			Gifted with innate courage, tenacity and intelligence, dragons are enthusiastic and confident.
		<br />
			They are not afraid of challenges, and willing to take risks. 
			
			However, the dragon is sometimes regarded as aggressive, and angry dragons are not open to criticism. 
		<br />	
			They don't consider themselves irritating and arrogant. 
		
			Instead of following the past, they are striving for a smooth and nice future.
